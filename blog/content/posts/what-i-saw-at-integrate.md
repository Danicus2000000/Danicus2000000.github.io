### Codeful Workflows

Integrate 2025 was a whirlwind of innovation and insights, and I’m excited to share some of the highlights that caught my attention. Here’s a breakdown of what I saw and learned:

#### Agentic Loops and Multi-Agent Hand-Offs

- **Agentic Loops**: A big push on workflows that leverage AI to create self-sustaining, codeful processes.

- **Multi-Agent Hand-Offs**: Two exciting features are on the horizon:
  - **State Machine-Based Hand-Offs** (Coming Soon)
  - **Nested Hand-Offs** (Coming Soon)

#### Microsoft Fabric and Real-Time Data

- A plethora of sessions showcased **Microsoft Fabric**, emphasizing real-time data access and manipulation.

- Examples of **data ingestion and storage**, with insights into **Data Lakes**, **Data Warehouses**, and the emerging **Data Lakehouse** paradigm.

#### Azure Service Bus and Chaos Studio

- A look at the **Service Bus Roadmap**, including features like **Cross-Namespace Forwarding**.

- **Chaos Studio** demonstrated its capabilities for simulating **Azure Region Down** scenarios, a must-have for resilience testing.

#### Logic Apps and Codeful Workflows

- As someone new to **Logic Apps**, I was amazed by the sheer scale—over **1400+ connectors** (or so I’m told)!

- **Codeful Workflows**: Writing workflows for Logic Apps via programming is coming to public preview, complete with a **strongly-typed SDK**.

- **Azure Logic Apps Hybrid**: Targeting semi-connected on-prem servers.

- **Azure Control Plane**: Access to **Azure ARC** for hybrid management.

#### SRE Agent and Prompt Templates

- **SRE Agent**: A tool to monitor and triage problems continuously and quickly.

- **Prompt Templates**: Reusable AI prompts for organizations, including:
  - **Organizational Templates**
  - **Template Workflows** for easy sharing and reuse.

#### Metadata and Messaging

- A large focus on **metadata** in messaging, especially for **AI assistance**.

- **Azure Event Grid**: Updates on namespaces, MQTT, and AMPQ.

- **JSON Structure**: A project aiming to introduce a more structured format on top of JSON.

#### Legacy Data Exchange and Modern Solutions

- **EDI with Azure Logic Apps + APIM**: Support for AS12, X12, and EDIFACT.

- A fantastic session by **Bill Chesnut** on modernizing legacy data exchange.

#### FinOps and Fraud Detection

- **Help! My Azure Bill Keeps Getting Larger**: A session by **Michael Stephenson** on using **Turbo 360** to manage Azure costs and improve FinOps.

- **Fraud Detection with APIM and Fabric**: A real-time data session by **Massimo Crippa** showcasing anomaly detection.

### Final Thoughts

Integrate 2025 was an information overload in the best way possible. From **Logic Apps** to **Microsoft Fabric**, the sessions were packed with actionable insights and exciting roadmaps. I left with a deeper understanding of **integration hubs**, **data evolution**, and the importance of **metadata** in modern workflows. I definitely recommend it!
