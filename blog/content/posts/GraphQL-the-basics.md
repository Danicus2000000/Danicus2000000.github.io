### What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an open-source data query language developed by Facebook in 2012, which was then released as an open-source project in 2015. Unlike traditional RESTful APIs, which require specific endpoints for data retrieval, GraphQL adopts a different approach. Instead of fetching entire resources, GraphQL allows clients to request the specific data they require from requested objects.

### The Need for GraphQL

Facebook struggled with performance issues in its mobile application during the early 2010s. The sheer volume of data being requested, including every user, post, comment, and article on a users feed led to slow loading times, high data consumption, and excessive battery drain on client devices.

### Key Differences Between GraphQL and REST

While both GraphQL and REST are stateless, they differ significantly in their approach and implementation. GraphQL introduces distinct keywords such as query, mutation, and subscription, replacing the standard GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods used in REST. Moreover, GraphQL enforces strong typing, requiring explicit declaration of object types, unlike the loosely typed nature of REST.

### Pros and Cons of GraphQL

The advantages of GraphQL lie in its ability to reduce redundant data transmission and enforcement of data validation through strong typing. However, GraphQL’s trust in client-side operations raises security concerns in some implementations, as without proper external security measures in place it can be exploited. Additionally, managing evolving and ever increasing complexity within GraphQL schemas can be challenging without proper governance and oversight.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, GraphQL offers an alternative to traditional RESTful APIs, in some scenarios this can streamline the data query process and enhance performance. While its flexibility and efficiency are commendable, GraphQL’s security implications and schema complexity should be carefully considered Ultimately, the choice between GraphQL and REST depends on the specific needs, priorities and technology available.

Do not let that dishearten you, I personally would really recommend exploring and playing with GraphQL in personal projects, ASP .NET Core, with the [Hot Chocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-platform) package for example is great for exploring implementing the root concepts of GraphQL.
